            <p class="para">
              Mexican food is a common favorite cuisine in America. From chili
              con carne to enchiladas, spicy Mexican dishes are a popular
              choice. Western restaurants typically use Northern Mexican
              cuisine, but there are a number of other options. Ancient Mayan
              dishes have a subtler flavor while Central and Southern Mexico
              have a sophisticated taste. Restaurant goers can enjoy eggs,
              vegetables, beans, chilies and cumin in major Mexican dishes.
              Chocolate, tomatoes and salsa are always favorites as well.

              India is one of the most densely populated countries on the
              planet. With so many people within the nation, Indian cuisine is
              highly varied. Curries are the traditional fare, but Indian food
              is not confined for just curry. There are a number of regions that
              make vegetarian dishes, and ayurvedic medicinal traditions are
              often used in creating food. Within India, visitors will find a
              range of sweet, hot and spicy dishes. Even better, the nation is
              home to millions of street food stands. At these stands, visitors
              can try out unique treats for a very cheap price.

            <p class="para">
              With a culinary history that stretches back centuries, Italian
              cuisine is one of the worlds favorites. Spumoni ice cream,
              spaghetti, lasagna and pizza are traditional dishes that are
              widely available in the United States. Beyond these basic dishes,
              there are a number of regional favorites like Parmesan cheese and
              Parma ham. One part of Italy is even known for making a kind of
              maggot cheese. The cheese is fermented and allowed to sit out so
              that flies lay eggs. Afterward, it is packed at the perfect time
              for maggots to develop.

              Say Oui, Oui to French cuisine! Five-star chefs are often trained
              in French cooking. It uses cheese, chocolate and baguettes for
              delicious meals. Of course, a French meal would never be complete
              without some wine! Despite their focus on cheese, bread and
              chocolates, the French amazingly remain thin. Perhaps eating more
              of this cuisine could be a weight loss plan?

          This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is
          also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what they’re
          talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their
          main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics and some
          twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.

          When we think about celebrations, Foodie Restaurant is always our
          first option and it never disappoints. From the starter to the dessert
          the quality and tastes of everything was outstanding, my Indian Food,
          French Food, Mexican Food might have been the best meal I have ever
          been served. Service was delightful and very professional.

          This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Banglore. The food is
          always fantastic and no matter what I order I am always delighted with
          my meal! Servers are also great and always efficient, happy and
          polite. Can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to
          anyone looking for somewhere to eat in

          I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in Foodie
          Restaurant. I had a 3 course meal, with a couple of beers. Considering
          the quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want a
          romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger groups.
